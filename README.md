# cs-cards-showroom
A basic HTML/CSS/JS project that showcases different CSS cards - just a personal project to experiment and showcase FrontEnd skillz :)

This project is a collection of different hero/profile/item cards, and was intended for practicing my CSS styling and CSS transformations skills.
It is built with HTML, CSS and Javascript only.

Inspirations werre taken from CodePen projects by other individuals - find full list below - and used as a template image for designing the cards.
In some cases I copied the HTML code from it´s original codepen.

The CSS code is written by myself in it´s entirety, without any help of the original codebases.
